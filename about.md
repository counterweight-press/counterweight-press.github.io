<h1>About this project</h1>

<p>Every nation tells itself stories. These stories explain who we are, where we came from, and why we do what we do. They shape policy, justify wars, and define enemies. They are taught in schools and repeated on television until they feel like facts.</p>

<p>But stories have narrators. And narrators have positions.</p>

<p>The dominant narrative is not always wrong. But it is always incomplete. There are other perspectives — held by other nations, other peoples, other witnesses to the same events — that rarely make it into the conversation. Not because they're secret, but because they're inconvenient. They complicate the story. They ask uncomfortable questions.</p>

<p><strong>Counterweight</strong> collects these other perspectives. Not to argue that one side is right and another wrong, but to restore balance. To provide the context that gets left out when nations talk about what they're owed, what they've sacrificed, and what they deserve.</p>

<p>These pieces are researched and sourced. They are also, by design, one-sided — because they exist to counterbalance narratives that already dominate. Read them alongside the stories you already know, not instead of them.</p>

<p>There are no authors here. No bylines, no bios, no personal brands. The words are what matter. Judge them on their own terms.</p>

<p>History has more than one narrator. This is the other one.</p>
